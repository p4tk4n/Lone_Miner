Version Alpha.2

-added a light source to the player, making him more visible and making the cave enviroment look better
-added a particle effect with a texture when breaking blocks
-added a vignette effect, still adjusting the values to make it look fitting (it made the game
look horror like, so im trying to boost the colors of the enviroment to something more lively).
-added a rolling/scattering effect to the mined blocks, they now roll around when mined which is pretty cool
-updated the code and the physics material of "item" scene.
-added a range the player can zoom in/out in. max zoom out is 1.5 and max zoom in is 5.
-added a highlight square when hovering over the slots in the inventory,
the square highlights the current slot thats being hovered over
-updated the inventory texture to be a grid of item slots, looks nicer

-added a hotbar that has no usage yet
-fixed the bounds of the highlight slot in the inventory, now it can only be located inside of the inventory
-added a basic building system, but it doesnt consume resources, the player can place blocks too fast(looks like painting),
there is just one buidling block type and it cant be changed or selected. This is the upcoming challenge to tackle, stay tuned!
-added a main menu with a play and exit button
-added a fading transition when entering the game or when exiting it
-added a lone miner logo to the main menu
-added a moving light across the logo, it lights up the menu
-removed the inventory system completly, it wasnt as scaleable as it needed, the hotbar couldnt be implemented with it so off it goes
